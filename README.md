# TTV_posteriors

Collection of transit timing variation (TTV) posteriors for the Kepler planets analyzed in Teachey, Kipping, and Schmitt 2017 (submitted to AJ July 26, 2017). Fits include Rp/Rstar (p), stellar density (rhostar), impact parameter (b), two limb darkening coefficients (q1 and q2), and transit timings (tau).

IMPORTANT NOTES:

1) the fits were performed in segments for planets with > 10 transits. Segments are indicated as seg0, seg1, seg2, etc. Please note that each segment was fit totally independently, so even though transit times for seg0 and seg1 are listed on the same row, they are NOT a single draw from the joint posteriors.

2) segN_tauM is the Mth transit in the Nth segment, and is in the format BJD - 2400000.
